Static portfolio website for Hafidz Mulia, focused on full-stack web development work across Laravel, Next.js, GIS, reporting systems, and health-tech products.

## About

This portfolio is used as a public showcase for:

- Full-stack product delivery with Laravel, PHP, Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- Database-driven systems using MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Appwrite, and Firebase
- Admin dashboards, reporting tools, operational systems, and education platforms
- Public project cards plus detailed project case-study pages via `porto-show.html`

## Project Catalog

The projects section is now driven from `js/project-data.js` and grouped into switchable categories instead of a single static featured list.

Default front view highlights latest featured work such as:

- `nechcode.id`
- `THYVA`
- `SOULMOM`
- `REAL KEKE`
- `PREMOM`
- `HISurabaya`
- `ELKPD`
- `Rapor HIMATIKA`

Available project filters include:

- `Featured`
- `All Repos`
- `Next.js / React`
- `Laravel / PHP`
- `GIS / Maps`
- `Health-Tech`
- `Education`
- `Internal Systems`
- `Frontend`
- `Experiments`

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5
- Google Fonts

### Portfolio Data Layer
- `js/project-data.js` contains shared portfolio metadata for featured projects
- `porto-show.html` reads project slugs from query parameters and renders detailed project pages
- `js/porto-show.js` handles detail-page rendering and screenshot carousel behavior

### Tooling
- Git and GitHub
- Formspree
- Static hosting via custom domain

## Project Structure

```text

|-- porto-show.html
|-- README.md

```

## Adding Project Screenshots Later

Each featured project already has a dedicated detail page rendered from `porto-show.html?project=<slug>`.

To add screenshots later:

1. Put the new image files inside `img/projects/<slug>/`
2. Open `js/project-data.js`
3. Add screenshot objects inside the relevant project's `screenshots` array:

```js
screenshots: [
  {
    image: 'img/projects/hisurabaya/dashboard-1.png',
    title: 'Dashboard View',
    description: 'Short explanation of what this screen shows.'
  }
]
```

If no screenshots are defined, the detail page shows carousel placeholders automatically.

## Local Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a browser, or use Live Server in VS Code
3. Update content in `index.html`, `js/project-data.js`, and `README.md` as needed
